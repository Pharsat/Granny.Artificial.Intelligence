<B>INVITATION:</B>

   You are invited to submit a paper for consideration. All accepted papers
   will be published by IEEE CPS in the proceedings of The 2020
   International Conference on Computational Science and Computational
   Intelligence (CSCI). Extended versions of selected papers of the
   conference will also appear in journals and edited research books
   (Springer, Elsevier, BMC, ...) The published proceedings can be accessed
   via web portals, IEEE CPS, other Digital libraries.

   CSCI'20 International Conference is composed of a number of symposiums,
   sessions, workshops, posters and panel discussions; all will be held
   simultaneously, same location and dates: December 16-18, 2020.


<B>PRESENTATION MODES:</B>

   In case of hesitation by some authors/speakers to travel during Year 2020
   (due to COVIC-19 or other pandemics), the CSCI Steering Committee has
   developed a policy in regards to presentation modes - please refer to:
   https://www.american-cse.org/csci2020/presentation_modes 
   In summary: the policy allows remote presentaions (interactive and also
   non-interactive) as well as on site presentation.


<B>SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:</B>

   The 2020 CSCI International Conference invites paper submissions from
   diverse communities, including researchers from: universities,
   corporations, government agencies, and standardization bodies. Papers
   are sought that address solutions to problems in all areas of
   computational science and computational intelligence.

   Computational Science is the study of addressing problems that are
   impossible to solve (or difficult to solve) without computers. The
   field is interdisciplinary by nature and includes the use of advanced
   computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. In
   short, Computational Science is the science of using computers to do
   science. Computational Intelligence is the study of computational
   methods in ways that exhibit intelligence. These methods adapt to
   changing environments and changing goals.

   Considering the above broad outline, the International Conference on
   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'20) is
   composed of the following research and technical tracks:

   - Computational Science (CSCI-ISCS)
   - Computational Intelligence (CSCI-ISCI)
   - Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, & Cyber Security (CSCI-ISCW)
   - Signal & Image Processing, Computer Vision & Pattern
     Recognition (CSCI-ISPC)
   - Smart Cities and Smart Mobility (CSCI-ISSC)
   - Education (CSCI-ISED) - STEM, CS & CE; includes accreditation,
     such as ABET
   - Health Informatics and Medical Systems (CSCI-ISHI)
   - Mobile Computing, Wireless Networks, & Security (CSCI-ISMC)
   - Software Engineering (CSCI-ISSE)
   - Internet of Things & Internet of Everything (CSCI-ISOT)
   - Big Data and Data Science (CSCI-ISBD)
   - Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-ISAI)
   - Social Network Analysis, Social Media, & Mining (CSCI-ISNA)
   - Cloud Computing and Data Centers (CSCI-ISCC)
   - Computational Biology (CSCI-ISCB)
   - Parallel & Distributed Computing (CSCI-ISPD)

TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  Please note that the number of pages stated below includes all figures,
  tables, and references - if the authors need extra pages, then the
  editors would permit one extra page above and beyond the maximum number
  of pages stated here at no extra charge.

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that represent a
    contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for the
    results and conclusions should also be provided. The work presented
    in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
    some additional work can be published as journal papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide
    overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented
    in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
    some additional work can be published as regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in
    their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to
    provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.


<B>REVIEW PROCESS:</B>

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers
   that are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for
   panel discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be
   maintained.  Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality,
   impact, significance, quality of research, quality of writing, and
   contribution to conference program and diversity. Papers whose authors
   include one or more members of the program committee will be evaluated
   using the double-blinded review process. Authors whose papers are not
   selected for publication can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will
   be evaluated by 4 members of the Program Committee.
